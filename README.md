### story
search internet,many people include me  get answer that ionic don't support cookies authentication,we must use request header instead of cookies.

for my experience,the difficult work is that i can't catch cookie log,so i dont know is't been set in the webview,i write this article show how do i catch cookies log and the server config.iI have tested on ios and and android ,both are work very well.

at last,we set up a gateway to set cookies by Nginx,it work good too.
